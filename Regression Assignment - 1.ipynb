    "Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. However, linear regression comes with several assumptions that must be met for the model to be valid. These assumptions are important to ensure that the estimated coefficients are unbiased, efficient, and reliable. Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. This means that a change in the independent variables is associated with a constant change in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. In other words, the value of the error for one data point should not be dependent on the values of errors for other data points. This assumption is often referred to as the assumption of independence or no autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance): The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same across the range of predicted values. If the variance of the residuals increases or decreases with the predicted values, it violates the assumption of homoscedasticity, which can lead to problems like heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality of Residuals: The residuals should be normally distributed. In other words, the distribution of the residuals should follow a bell-shaped curve with a mean of zero. Departures from normality can affect the accuracy of the hypothesis tests and confidence intervals associated with the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No Multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression (when there are multiple independent variables), there should be no perfect multicollinearity, which means that the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can make it difficult to isolate the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can use various diagnostic techniques and statistical tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Residual Plots**: Create residual plots to visually inspect the linearity, homoscedasticity, and independence of errors. A scatterplot of residuals against predicted values can help identify non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normality Tests**: Use normality tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plots to assess the normality of the residuals. If the residuals significantly depart from a normal distribution, you may need to consider transformations or robust regression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multicollinearity Checks**: Calculate correlation coefficients or use variance inflation factors (VIF) to detect multicollinearity among independent variables. High correlations or VIF values suggest multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Durbin-Watson Test**: The Durbin-Watson test helps assess the independence of errors. A value close to 2 indicates no significant autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **White's Test**: White's test for heteroscedasticity can formally test for the presence of non-constant variance in the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cook's Distance**: Cook's distance can help identify influential data points that may disproportionately affect the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Histograms and Boxplots**: Visualize the distribution of residuals through histograms and boxplots to check for normality and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these assumptions are violated, you may need to consider alternative regression techniques, such as robust regression, transformations, or addressing multicollinearity. It's important to remember that linear regression assumptions are simplifications of real-world data, and in practice, some deviation from these assumptions is often acceptable as long as it doesn't severely impact the model's reliability and validity."

You decide to use linear regression to model this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Intercept (β0):\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The intercept represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. However, it may not always have a meaningful interpretation, especially in contexts where a zero value for the independent variable is not possible or meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In our real estate scenario, the intercept (β0) could represent the base price of a house with zero square feet. This doesn't make sense since houses have positive sizes, so the intercept might not have a practical interpretation in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Slope (β1):\n",
    "\n",
    "   The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. In our real estate example, the slope (β1) would indicate how much the sale price of a house changes for each additional square foot of living space.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if the slope is (β1 = 200), it means that, on average, for each additional square foot of living space in a house, you would expect the sale price to increase by $200. So, if a house has 1,000 additional square feet compared to another, you would expect it to be priced $200,000 higher (1,000 square feet * $200) assuming all other factors are constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this scenario, the intercept may not have a meaningful interpretation, but the slope (β1) provides valuable information about how the sale price of a house changes with the size of the house. It quantifies the relationship between the two variables and allows you to make predictions based on changes in house size."

    "Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. Gradient descent in machine learning is simply used to find the values of a function's parameters (coefficients) that minimize a cost function as far as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fundamental technique for training a wide range of machine learning models, including linear regression, neural networks, and support vector machines. The core idea behind gradient descent is to iteratively update the model's parameters in the direction of the steepest decrease in the cost function to find the optimal set of parameters that minimize the cost.\n",

    "2. Calculate the Cost Function: Evaluate the cost or loss function for the current set of parameters. The cost function measures how well the model's predictions match the actual target values. The goal is to minimize this cost.\n",

    "3. Calculate the Gradient: Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase in the cost. To minimize the cost, we need to move in the opposite direction, so we negate the gradient to get the direction of the steepest decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Update Parameters: Adjust the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. This adjustment is done using the learning rate (α), which controls the size of each step. The update rule for each parameter (θi) is:\n",

    "5. Repeat: Continue iterating steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Output: Once the algorithm converges (i.e., the cost function reaches a minimum or a near-minimum), the final set of parameters represents the solution that minimizes the cost, and the trained model can be used for making predictions."
